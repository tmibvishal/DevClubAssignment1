DevClub IIT Delhi is a student-managed Club that tries to provide all the enthusiastic students a platform for enhancing their development skills. 
This club will make us work on group projects which are a must to learn the real world development. But before that club will help us learn the basics of topics like git, android development and web development and much more. 
I am looking forward to work with the like-minded people on some amazing projects.
